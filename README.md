# deventure-game

Deventure is a short text based role playing game made in Python. There is a version for each operating system so you don't need Python installed on the system to run it.

## Deventure.py

This is the original .py file in which the game was made in. Since it was developed on a Linux machine, the function to clear the console won't work on a Windows machine. Also it is a Python file so you need to have Python (specifically Python 3) installed on your system for this to work correctly. 

## Native Files

This directory contains the game ported to Windows, Mac, and Linux executable files. Since these are standalone executables, you don't need Python to run them. It is recommended to use these for the best gameplay experience.
